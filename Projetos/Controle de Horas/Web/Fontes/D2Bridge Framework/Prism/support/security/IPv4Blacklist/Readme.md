# D2Bridge Framework
D2Bridge Framework is Delphi Web.
This Framework was designed to compile your Delphi project on the Web, all processing is done synchronously, nothing changes in your Delphi code or in your existing project. You keep your project as is and only export what is visual, it is as if your project suddenly turned into a BackEnd. Third-party components are also supported.
